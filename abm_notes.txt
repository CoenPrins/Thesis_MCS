Stap 1 

Make sure the pathing works for path 1 etc. Right now the data is weird. 
DONE!

Stap 2. 

Initialise a fuckton of particles (for now N=100) in a diameter of 10 meter (source)
around the initial location! Nope, 

We initialise them in a radius, this radius needs to be wall chosen 


-Make sure their size is dependent of their weight (make particles orange)
- make the average BRIGHT RED (and nothing else can be red!)



-weigh them based on distance to measurement. 
	- We take total distance
	- We divide distance by total distane. 
	- that's the weight and that should already be normalised
	- check sum of weights!!!


- Then generate new particles based on weight! 

	- you give a chance for each particle to produce new ones. 

	- How do you keep N the same? 

	- look at coding examples!!!




- Now you will move the particles!!!


- consider a reasonable distance and move them all! (I think randomly)
- Move them all in a straight line with a speed randomly chosen from max walking speed +0.1 to 0. 


- Now compare them to new measurement,
