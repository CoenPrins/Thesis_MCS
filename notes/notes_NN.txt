Make switches for the test paths so that you can toggle those. 

Fix the representation to be clear!

Make it possible to see 

ORIGINAL TEST PATH
K-NN A
K-NN B 

All in the same display. 


#MAKE THE AVERAGE all the paths 


# average is going to be it's own seperate thing 

# It is going to be seperated in different paths, like the OG coords. 

# It will contain.

# create python file that 

# create an imperfect one for james (we have to sync the time intervals better)

1. strips the dt files to their time interval. 
2. Go in steps of 10 seconds over the time interval. 
3. Go over all the 5 dt files 
4. The entries used to calculate are the new (path = false)
5. 



We are dealing with an average here of 4 different dt's 

First make an average of these four dt's! 

We can let this run tonight! 

We need to compute these averages!
